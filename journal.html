         <h3>Week 1</h3>
         <p> Starting out on the first day I feel like I know enough to make a
             very basic app with no outside help outside of just googling things.
             My biggest struggles in this early stage is objects and their key value
             pairs, also creating functions within javascript and figuring out how those
             functions fit in to the html and also within the javascript document. Thirdly,
             and perhaps the biggest issue is just remembering what does what, although
             with more reps I will remember how to do these things much easier.
         </p>
         In terms of what has improved I think I feel more comfortable now in knowing
         I don't know. I often know what I'm trying to do now, but just don't know
         the best methods to accomplish what I'm trying to do. Looking forward to
         learning more of javascript's built in functions as I have found those to be
         very handy in shortening up code and being the simplest way to get functions
         up and running, when possible, as not every issue can be solved with them.
